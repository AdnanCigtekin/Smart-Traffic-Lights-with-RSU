# Smart-Traffic-Lights-with-RSU
This is a school project which me and my partner developed throughout the spring of 2019.

## Abstract
Current  traffic  lights  approach  is  based  on  pre-defined  cycles  or  manual  control.  This  primitive  approach  forhandling the lights creates an environment that cannot be scalablefor  its  current  traffic  situation.  According  to  our  observationscurrent  system  is  prone  to  be  inefficient.  Because,  in  currentsystem the duration of red and green lights are static. However,the car amount in the traffic varies through the day. This causesunnecessary  waiting  time  for  the  vehicles  in  the  traffic.  Evenwith  the  light  duration  which  have  been  calculated  beforehandaccording  to  congestion  of  the  traffic  through  the  day,  we  stillcanâ€™t overcome the possibility of exceptions. For example, whensomeone   important   or   famous   uses   that   road   unexpectedly,the  traffic  at  the  lights  will  increase  and  people  will  start  towait  longer  at  the  lights.  This  might  cause  problems  even  foreconomics  of  that  country.  [1]  So,  this  problem  must  be  solved.To  solve  this  issue  we  developed  a  new  approach
