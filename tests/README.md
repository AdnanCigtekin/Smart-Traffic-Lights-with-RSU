## Instructions to execute the test script
In order to execute the 'simulationScript.py' follow these steps:
- Install SUMO.	(the traffic simulation program that we used)
- Declare the environment variable named 'SUMO_HOME'
	Example SUMO_HOME decleration for linux:	
		export SUMO_HOME=/home/sumo-0.25.0/sumo/
- Open up the 'simulationScript.py' and declare the output file location in the variable named "FILE_LOCATION"
- execute "python3 simulationScript.py" in the terminal

NOTE : Further instructions are included in the code as comments. :)
